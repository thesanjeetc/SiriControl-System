SiriControl is an open source framework designed with developers in mind. It provides a simple way of using Siri commands by dynamically loading modules created by the user. This means that you can add voice controlled capability to any project, with Siri.

- No extra hardware required as the commands are being sent through the iOS device
- Runs on any computer with python installed – the Raspberry Pi is especially good as you can make it control anything around you. The possibilities are endless with your imagination being the limit.
- It is beginner friendly with minimal setup required – I have provided step by step instructions on how to set it up. It is written in python which is quite an easy language to pick up.
- You will get the power of Siri’s fantastic speech recognition capabilities, and will be able to use it from anywhere in the world, as long as your device has an internet connection.

Overall, you will be able to add accurate voice controlled capabilities to any project for free.
